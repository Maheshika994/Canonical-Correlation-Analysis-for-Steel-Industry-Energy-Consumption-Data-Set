# Canonical-Correlation-Analysis-for-Steel-Industry-Energy-Consumption-Data-Set
In this project, I applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to explore the relationships between energy usage and environmental factors in a steel industry dataset. The analysis identified strong correlations, providing insights for optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs in steel production.
